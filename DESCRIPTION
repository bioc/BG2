Description: This package is built to perform GWAS analysis for non-Gaussian data using BG2. The BG2 method uses penalized quasi-likelihood along with nonlocal priors in a two step manner to identify SNPs in GWAS analysis. The research related to this package was supported in part by National Science Foundation awards DMS 1853549 and DMS 2054173.
